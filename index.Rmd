I am Sebastian A. C. Perrig, PhD, a researcher at the Human-Computer Interaction Research Group within the Center for General Psychology and Methodology at the University of Basel, Switzerland. My passion lies in advancing measurement methodology and scale construction to effectively capture diverse aspects of users' experiences with interactive technology. My current research focuses on understanding and measuring User Experience (UX), exploring which elements are crucial for defining and understanding UX, and how to make UX more tangible. A significant aspect of my work involves critically reviewing existing UX questionnaires and developing new scales. One particular area that captivates me is the role of aesthetics in UX. I investigate how product aesthetics influence user experience and interaction, methods for measuring aesthetic appeal, and its interplay with other key UX factors. Beyond UX, my research extends into other areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly into the realms of Player Experience (PX) and users' trust in artificial intelligence. These areas complement my broader goal of enhancing our understanding and measurement capabilities across different facets of HCI.
