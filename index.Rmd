<p style="text-align: justify"> My name is Sebastian A. C. Perrig. I am a Ph.D. candidate at the Human-Computer Interaction Research Group of the Center for General Psychology and Methodology, Faculty of Psychology, University of Basel, Switzerland. I am intrigued by measurement methodology and scale construction to capture various constructs that constitute users' experiences. Thus, I am interested in measuring user experience (UX), which aspects are considered relevant for UX, and how UX can be made more tangible. Reviewing and comparing existing UX questionnaires and developing new relevant scales are the focus of my research. One particular construct of UX that fascinates me especially is aesthetics. My research thus also addresses how a product's aesthetics affect users' experience and interaction with a product, how we can measure aesthetics, and how it relates to other constructs relevant to UX. </p>
