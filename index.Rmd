My name is Sebastian A. C. Perrig. I work in research support with a focus on research data management at the University of Applied Sciences and Arts Northwestern Switzerland (FHNW). Previously, I was a researcher in the Human-Computer Interaction Research Group at the University of Basel, where I completed my PhD in Psychology. My main interest during my PhD lay in advancing measurement methodology and scale construction to effectively capture diverse aspects of users' experiences with interactive technology. My research focused on understanding and measuring UX, exploring which elements are crucial for defining and understanding UX, and making UX more tangible. A significant aspect of my work involved critically reviewing existing UX questionnaires and developing new scales, as well as improving measurement practices and transparency in scale-based UX research. One particular area that captivated me is the role of aesthetics in UX. I investigated how product aesthetics influence users' experience and interaction, methods for measuring aesthetic appeal, and their interplay with other key UX factors. Beyond UX, my research extended into other areas of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI), particularly the realms of Player Experience (PX) and users' trust in artificial intelligence. These areas complemented my broader goal of enhancing our understanding and measurement capabilities across different facets of HCI.
